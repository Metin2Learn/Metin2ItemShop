      <description>This is a fix for a DoS Vulnerability where invalid player ids are spammed (i.e. HEADER_CG_CHARACTER_SELECT), you can confirm this by looking in the syslog for a bunch of [PLAYER_LOAD] Load from PlayerDB pid[0] open input_login.cpp and add above db_clientdesc-&amp;gt;DBPacket(HEADER_GD_PLAYER_LOAD, d-&amp;gt;GetHandle(), &amp;amp;player_load_packet, sizeof(TPlayerLoadPacket)); if (player_load_packet.player_id == 0) { sys_err(&amp;#34;invalid player_id from account %d\n&amp;#34;,c_r.id); d-&amp;gt;DelayedDisconnect(0); return; } it should look like following if (player_load_packet.player_id == 0) { sys_err(&amp;#34;invalid player_id from account %d\n&amp;#34;,c_r.</description>

      <description>the sectree in metin2 is scary and not even the old korean wizards know what the fuck is happening over there so I took a deep breath and started to change some stuff around. While doing so I found something strange, after around 2.5-5k mobs the ram is exploding and its getting extremely laggy. I noticed that every server-source/game/src/entiy.h -&amp;gt; CEntity has its own
ENTITY_MAP m_map_view;
But what is a ENTITY_MAP?</description>

      <description>Hello, today I saw that people are using the old collsion rendering code from ymir and I think its disgusting and useless to be honest. The new method is using wire framed 3d meshes instead of weird circles that look like a psychosis. You enable the collision rendering by opening the console and run the &amp;ldquo;collision&amp;rdquo; command
Before After this is only in the client source.
GameLib/ActorInstanceRender.cpp search for void CActorInstance::RenderCollisionData() and replace whole function with</description>
